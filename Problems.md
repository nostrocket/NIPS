## Logging a New Problem
* `.Kind` 1971
* `.Tags`
	* [üöÄMUST, STABLE]`e` pointer to the Nostrocket root event, with the marker `root`
	* [üçåSHOULD, RAW]`e` pointer to the top level problem in a non-Nostrocket Problem Tree, with the marker `root`
	* [MUST, DRAFT]`text` tag with the marker `tldr`: contains a once sentence explanation of the problem in `<=` 100 characters
	* [SHOULD, DRAFT]`text` tag with the marker `paragraph`: contains a one paragraph explanation of the problem in `<=` 280 characters
	* [OPTIONAL, DRAFT]`text` tag with the marker `page`: contains a detailed explanation of the problem, ideally in something like one page. Markdown is allowed.
	* [SHOULD, DRAFT]`e` pointer to the parent of this problem with the marker `parent`, MAY incude multiple parents by including additional tags
	* [üöÄSHOULD, DRAFT]`e` pointer to a Rocket from which to get Maintainers (Nostrocket Rocket is used by default if none specified) 
	* [SHOULD, RAW]`tip` tag with the current Bitcoin tip when this event is published `<height>:<hash>`
	* [SHOULD, DRAFT] current lifecycle status of the problem and the pubkey that requested a change to this status (if applicable): `["status", "<open || claimed || patched || closed">, "<pubkey>", "<witnessed height (bitcoin)>"]`.
	* [OPTIONAL, RAW] `labels` tag with a list of event IDs to label and sort/filter problems by, e.g. a programming language, difficulty level, rocket, other problems, etc.
	* [MUST, RAW] IF this is a new Problem (not modifying an existing problem), an empty `new` tag MUST be included. 
* `.Content` empty.

## Modifying a Problem

To modify a Problem, the problem creator or a Maintainer MUST publish another `Kind 1971` event with the modifications included. Clients SHOULD render the latest event published by a valid pubkey (creator or Maintainer).

* `.Tags`
	* [MUST, DRAFT] `e` pointer to the Problem this event modifies, with the marker `problem`
	* [MUST, RAW] `e` pointer to the latest known Problem modification event (if any), with the marker `previous`.
* `.Content` [OPTIONAL, RAW] An explanation of why this is being modified. If included, this should be displayed as a comment.

## Problem Lifecycle
To signal that a Participant wants to work on a Problem, they SHOULD reply to the problem event:

* `.Kind` 1972
* `.Tags`
	* [üöÄMUST, STABLE]`e` pointer to the Nostrocket root event, with the marker `root`
	* [üçåSHOULD, RAW]`e` pointer to the top level problem in a non-Nostrocket Problem Tree, with the marker `root`
	* [MUST, STABLE]`e` pointer to the `1971` problem event with the marker `problem`.
	* [MUST, DRAFT]`["status", "<open || claimed || patched || closed>"`  

After claiming a problem, the Participant SHOULD produce a patch or other solution within 432 blocks. If no solution is forthcoming within this time limit, the problem will be automatically freed for others to solve.

A Maintainer MAY provide extra time in response to a request by the Participant who claimed the proble. This is done by publishing a new `kind 1971` event with a modified claim timestamp.

To abandon a previously claimed Problem and signal that this problem is no longer being worked on, the current claiment SHOULD publish another `1972` event with the status `open`

To signal that a problem has been solved and the solution is ready to be verified, the person solving the problem SHOULD publish another `1972` event with the status `patched`, and follow up with a comment linking to a merged or proposed patch, and provide any explanation if required.

Upon witnessing any valid lifecycle change, clients should display the new status immediately, and a Maintainer SHOULD solidify this new status with a new `1971` event modifying the problem to reflect the new status, time of the change, and pubkey of the requestor.

If a Participant repeatedly claims problems and fails to deliver a solution or request a time extension and does not provide a reasonable explanation, they SHOULD be asked to self correct, and removed from the Identity Tree if they are unable to do so.
