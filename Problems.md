## Modifying a Problem

To modify a Problem, the problem creator or a Maintainer MUST publish another `Kind 1971` event with the modifications included. Clients SHOULD render the latest event published by a valid pubkey (creator or Maintainer).
* `.Tags`
	* [MUST] `e` pointer to the Problem this event modifies, with the marker `problem`
	* [SHOULD] `e` pointer to the latest known Problem modification event (if any), with the marker `previous`.
* `.Content` [OPTIONAL] An explanation of why this is being modified. If included, this should be displayed as a comment.


## Problem Lifecycle
To signal that a problem is being worked on, a Participant SHOULD publish a NIP25 reaction in response to the Problem, with the üí™ emoji in the content. This SHOULD include an `e` tag of the Problem, AND an `e` tag of the latest known modification event with the marker `previous`.

To abandon a previously claimed Problem and signal that this problem is no longer being worked on, the current claiment SHOULD publish a NIP25 reaction with the üòì emoji in the content.

To signal that a problem has been solved and the solution is ready to be verified, the person solving the problem should react with üëå and also follow up with a comment if any explanation is requried.

Upon witnessing a lifecycle change, the creator of the problem or a Maintainer SHOULD modify the problem to reflect the new status.

After claiming a problem, the Participant SHOULD produce a patch or other solution within 432 blocks. If no solution is forthcoming within this time limit, a Maintainer MAY free the problem by modifying it to set the status to `open` such that other particpants can claim it.

If a Participant repeatedly claims problems and fails to deliver a solution and does not provide a reasonable explanation they SHOULD be asked to self correct, and removed from the Identity Tree if they are unable to do so.
