# NIP 31108 - Microsubjective Blockchain (MSB)
##### NIP1962 STATUS: RAW

## Protocol Flow
A Microsubjective Blockchain is a linked list of nostr events, with the most recent event containing the current state in full. Client implementations use a Web of Trust in combination with proof verification to determine which fork to follow and/or append on. 

The tip of the MSB is a replaceable event (kind `31108`) that contains the current state and the event ID of the previous state (most relay implementations provide the previous versions of replaced events if requested by ID). 

Instead of verifying the entire history of the MSB, clients MAY allow users to consume the current state directly from the latest `31108` event signed by pubkeys they trust. This allows meaningful interoperability with regular nostr clients that do not want to implement validation.

1. The project creator publishes a `kind 31108` event to create a new MSB. This is called the `ignition` event.
2. Anyone can fork and modify the state of the MSB by publishing a replacement `31108` event with the new state and proof(s) that the modification follows the protocol ruleset indicated by the `ignition` event.
3. A replacement `31108` event (i.e. all except the `ignition` event) MUST provide the ID of the `ignition` event at the root of this MSB, AND the ID of the most recent `31108` event that this builds upon.
4. To find the current state of the MSB, we request the latest `31108` events that have tagged the `ignition` event (from pubkeys we trust), and OPTIONALLY perform validation on the entire MSB back to the `ignition` event.
5. To signal that we are following a particular MSB tip, we publish a `31108` event to `shadow` it.

## MSB Tip State Event (kind: 31108)
The following tags are indicated for use in kind 31108 events.

### Metadata
| RFC 2119 | Description | Spec or Example |
|---|---|---|
|MUST|Ruleset identifier - the ruleset(s) that this MSB validates against.|`["ruleset", <hex>]`|
|SHOULD| Pointer to the `kind 31108` ignition event for this MSB. | `[ "ignition", <event ID> ]` |
|SHOULD| Pointer to the ID of the last `kind 31108` that this replacement is updating (MUST be the same pubkey). | `[ "parent", <event ID> ]` |
| MUST | The name or identifier of this MSB. | `[ "d", <name of this MSB> ]` |
| OPTIONAL | This is to signal that we agree with a specific `31108` event. If this is the first `31108` published by a new participant in the MSB it MUST include a pointer to the latest valid state of this MSB from which the new member will begin updating. | `["shadow", <ID of 31108 event> ]` |
| SHOULD | Current block, mostly for convenience. | `[ "bitcoin", "<current bitcoin height>:<hash>" ]` |

### Proofs
Some state changes MAY require a proof so that others can verify it if they wish. This can either contain the event ID of a proof, arbitrary data as a proof, or a full event as stringified JSON. A single update MAY contain multiple proofs.   
`[ "proof_id", <event ID of proof>, <relay hint> ]` 
`[ "proof_full", <stringified JSON of full event> ]`  
`[ "proof_raw", <proof type>:<proof data> ]`  


### Rulesets
MSB Rules define how to handle inputs (events that cause a state change), and how to modify the current state based on them.  

Rulesets are a way to compose these Rules and allow experimentation in a way that is clear and simple to reason about, and does not introduce non-determinism (i.e. does not encounter the halting problem).

We can think of a Ruleset as a portable set of atomic transaction validation rules that can be mixed and matched between any MSB. Like Bitcoin, MSB transaction execution does not encounter the halting problem because inputs are discrete and atomic requests to modify specific state(s).

Instead of allowing arbitrary inputs, we pre-state what inputs are allowed (as part of the ruleset), and we modify the ruleset to allow novel states and inputs. This allows MSBs to have infinite state possibilities and arbitrary mechanisms for validating state changes, but without invoking the fundamentally insecure and unpatchable "Turing complete" paradigm in use by "smart contract" platforms. This is important because doing so would make it impossible to perform full recognition of inputs prior to execution, and the lack of this capability is what makes things like the DAO hack possible.

Rulesets are identified with a hexadecimal code, for example `334000` for the first attempt at a ruleset for Nostrocket.

### Verification of state
Verification is not strictly required, participants may choose to simply trust the current `31108` event published by someone they trust, or the MSB creator.

If participants wish to verify the full state, they may do so by fetching any proofs contained in the event, and fetching the `parent` event. Applying the proof events to the `parent` event in the context of the parent's `ruleset` should result in the same state as the current event. The process should be repeated until the `ignition` event is reached.

If the participant's pubkey has power over consensus (based on the current ruleset in the context of the current state), the participant SHOULD publish a `shadow` of the most recent `31108` event.

### Replay protection
To prevent the accidental or intentional replay of proofs, we include a bloom filter array and validate that the candidate proof has not yet been included in this MSB. This will sometimes cause legitimate proofs to be rejected but client implementations can re-create them with a new ID if so.
