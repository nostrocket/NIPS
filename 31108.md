# NIP 31108 - Sovereign Economic Collectives

A Sovereign Economic Collective is a substrate for mixing sovereign human action.

### Protocol Flow
1. A person publishes a `kind 31108` event to  create a new SEC. This is called the `ignition` event.
2. If the creator of an SEC wants to update something, they may do so by publishing a replacement `31108` event with the modifications
3. The creator of an SEC may update the Hard State values of the SEC by publishing a replacement `31108` event and including a pointer to the event(s) containing evidence or justification for this modification.
4. All replacement `31108` events (i.e. all except the `ignition` event) MUST have a pointer to the ignition event's ID (not just an `a` tag), AND a pointer to the ID of the most recent update published by this pubkey.
5. When new members join an SEC and have `votepower > 0` (see NIP 1517), they SHOULD validate and publish the state of the SEC in their own 31108 event. Their first event MUST contain a pointer to the ID of the latest 31108 event published by the SEC creator (todo: this is good enough for a first pass but will eventually need to be updated to the more robust mechanism described in the Nostrocket Protocol).

### SEC State Event

#### Tags (metadata)
**[SHOULD]:** `[ "ignition", <event ID> ]` pointer to the `kind 31108` ignition event for this SEC.

**[MUST]:** `[ "d", <name of this SEC> ]`  
**[OPTIONAL]:** if this is published by a new member of the SEC with `votepower > 0` it MUST include a pointer to the latest valid state of this SEC: `["boostpoint", <ID of 31108 event> ]`.

#### Tags (merits)
Merits are the canonical representation of equity within the SEC. Upon approval of a new Merit Request, or a transfer or sale of an approved merit request (see NIP 1409), a tag entry is created or modified.   
`[ "merit", "owner:<pubkey>", "req:<event ID of merit request>", "lt:<current leadtime>", "amt:<number of merits>" ]`

#### Tags (products)
Product listings and incoming payments for products 


### Incoming Payments
An SEC has three options for handling the distribution of incoming payments (for products/services created by the SEC).   
#### Round Robin
When someone wants to purchase a product/service from an SEC, they are provided with an invoice from the next pubkey in a round robin derived from ratio between how many merits each pubkey holds and how many sats they have recieved for the life of the SEC. The distribution of incoming payments is eventually-consistent with the distribution of merits.

This is a totally non-custodial way to operate an SEC.

#### Cashu 
The creator of an SEC can spin up a Cashu mint on top of any funding source, with a dedicated LUD16 address for each product/service. 

When receving an incoming payment, their mint DMs each merit holder with the correct proportion of tokens based on their proportion of merits.

Merit holders can request a withdrawal at any time.

This can also be a service provided by another SEC. 

#### Manual Stop-gap
The simplest way to handle incoming payments is for the creator of an SEC to create a new LUD16 for incoming payments and provide a pubkey for valid zap receipts. When a zap receipt is published, the `kind 31108` event is updated to reflect the new outstanding amount owed to each merit holder.

#### Tags (satflow)
Instead of tracking satflow based on each pubkey (an accounts paradigm), we do it using approved merit requests (something akin to the UTXO model).

For each approved merit request:   
`[ "sats", <merit request ID>, <amount outstanding>, <amount paid> ] `
