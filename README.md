# NIPs
The NIPs in this repository describe how Nostrocket uses events.

## Key
Most Nostrocket data structures can be used with or without Nostrocket. When Nostrocket NIPs are used without being attached to the Nostrocket economic system, we say that it is being used *detached*. 

The following icons are used to represent what data should and should not be included in Events depending on whether the NIP is being consumed as part of the Nostrocket economic system, or if it's being used *detached* from Nostrocket.

* ‼️ This data MUST be incuded.   

* 🚀 MUST be included IF and ONLY IF used within Nostrocket (attached).  

* 🍌 MUST be included IF and ONLY IF used without Nostrocket (detached).
