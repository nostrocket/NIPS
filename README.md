## Key
Most Nostrocket data structures can be used with or without Nostrocket. When Nostrocket NIPs are used without being attached to the Nostrocket economic system, we say that it is being used *detached*. 

The following icons are used to represent what data should and should not be included in Events depending on whether the NIP is being consumed as part of the Nostrocket economic system, or if it's being used *detached* from Nostrocket.

* üöÄ Indicates that this is only applicable when when operating attached to Nostrocket.  

* üçå Indicates that this is only applicable when used in detached mode.
